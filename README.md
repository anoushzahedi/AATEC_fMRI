## README text (fMRI-compatible + joystick/response box version AATEC)

The experiment uses a within-subject design with one session to investigate participants’ choices. The study is **fMRI-compatible** and supports responses via **joysticks** and an **MRI response box**.

# Overview
The behavioral measurement contains three parts:

## Part 1: Preference and Choice
Two tasks are administered:

1. **Willingness to Pay (WTP)**
   Participants see pictures of toys one by one and indicate how much they are willing to pay for the presented toy on a continuous scale.

2. **Binary Choice Task**
   Pictures of toys are shown one by one, and participants choose whether they want to have the presented toy.

## Part 2: Attentional Tasks
Participants complete attentional tasks in which they respond to toys based on instructions. There are two tasks:

1. **Approach/Avoid Task (Sound-Cued)**
   Participants must approach or avoid shown toys based on a presented sound (e.g., high vs. low pitch).

2. **Emotion Categorization Task**
   Participants categorize emotional pictures as quickly as possible.

## Part 3: Post-Training Preference and Competitive Choice
Participants complete:

1. **Willingness to Pay (WTP)** (same as Part 1)
2. **Binary Choice Task** (same as Part 1)
3. **Competitive Choice Task**
   Two options are presented, and participants can choose only one.

### Important Notes
- **PLEASE BE AWARE:** The study contains several attention checks and attention tasks.
- **PLEASE BE AWARE:** During the experiment, you cannot be unresponsive for more than **3 minutes**. Otherwise, the tasks will end automatically.
- Response collection is configured to work with **joysticks** and an **MRI response box** (fMRI-compatible input setup).
